## My Definition of Big Data
With this day and age, data is increasing exponentially. Big data simply can be described as the process in collecting, processing, and analyzing data.

The size of "big data" can be subjective. However, collecting data may not be an easy task. A method in collecting data needs to be considered when dealing with cases like population and geography.<br>

"Grooming" data will be necessary too before analyzing it. This could mean cleaning up databases or sythesizing data together from different sources.<br>

Lastly, analyzing the data is necessary to gain a conclusion. Trends may be observed and more questions may come up to continue studying further.
